    <h2>Help/FAQs:</h2>
    
    <p>Q1: How do I add chores?</p>
    <p>A1: First you need to have chores in the “Chore Library”. The Chore Library is a repository of all the 
            available chores you can add. If you don’t have any rewards in your 
            “Reward Library”, you will need to add at least one of those first. It is locatred in the CHore Library link at the top of every page.
            Once you have chores in your chore library the dropdown list on the “Main Chore Board"</p>
    <br>
    <p>Q2: On the Chore Board, there are no chores to add in the dropdown list. How to I add chores?</p>
    <p>A2: You will need to add at least one chore into the Chore Library first. See FAQ 1 or click here to go there now.</p>
    <br>
    <p>Q3: How to I add rewards to my chores?</p>
    <p>A3: Go to the “Chore Library” and go down to the “Reward Library” section and add your rewards. Once you have 
        at least one reward added, you can now go up the “Chore Library” section and add a chore with a specific reward. 
        Now you can go to the “Main Chore Board” and assign a chore.</p>
